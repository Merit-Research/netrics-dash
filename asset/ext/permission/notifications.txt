The extension is intended for background execution; its browser action merely discovers the network address of the network-attached device and opens a browser tab to the device server's dashboard page. This action is also initiated upon extension installation, to introduce the dashboard to the participant. The notification system provides a straight-forward means of communicating additional information to the study participant in two instances: (1) upon extension installation, to explain the browser action to the participant and to remind the participant of the extension's background execution, and (2) upon participant's engaging the browser action, but when the network measurement device address cannot be determined, to explain this issue to the participant.
