The extension is expected to be inactive over the majority of its time, and only woken by the browser to respond to browser actions and to execute local network bandwidth tests. As such, two pieces of information must be cached in local storage, to ensure their persistence across periods of extension inactivity. (These are the determined address of the network-attached measurement device; and, the timestamp of the last tab/page load, by which the extension attempts to avoid initiating bandwidth tests during periods of participant network activity.)
