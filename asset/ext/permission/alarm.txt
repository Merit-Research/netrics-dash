Local network bandwidth tests are to be executed periodically. The alarm is necessary to "wake" the extension on the configured schedule. The extension then queries the network-attached device server to determine whether it should initiate a test. (These are limited to once every six hours across the network.) Depending on the server's response, the extension executes a local network bandwidth test. The extension is otherwise inactive.
