Execute local area network bandwidth tests to better understand study participants' real-world Internet experiences. This is a component expressly intended for study participants of the University of Chicago Internet Access & Equity Initiative, who have separately attached a measurement device to their network. Bandwidth tests are made possible by the Measurement Lab's NDT7 protocol and software: this extension packages the client, and the separate, network-attached device implements the server. (A data dashboard is also served by that separate device.)
